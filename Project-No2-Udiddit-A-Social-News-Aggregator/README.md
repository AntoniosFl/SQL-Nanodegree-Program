# Project Overview

I this project I had to make an assessment of a website and fix all the issues with the current data model, and then, once successful, to improve the current system by making it more robust and adding some web analytics. 

The website is called "Udiddit" and is a social news aggregator, content rating, and discussions website. On Udiddit, registered users are able to link to external content or post their own text content about various topics, ranging from common topics such as photography and food, to more arcane ones such as horse masks or birds with arms. In turn, other users can comment on these posts, and each user is allowed to cast a vote about each post, either in an up (like) or down (dislike) direction.

The project is divided into three parts:
 - **Part I:** *Investigate the existing schema*
 - **Part II**: *Create the DDL for the new schema*
 - **Part III**: *Migrate the data*
